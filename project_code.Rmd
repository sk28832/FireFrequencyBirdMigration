This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Recommend opening files as an object 

#Code if you want to download the fire data 
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/download/DL_FIRE_J1V-C2_251815.zip",temp,mode = "wb")
unzip(temp, "fire_nrt_J1V-C2_251815.csv")
fireData<- read.table("fire_nrt_J1V-C2_251815.csv", sep=",", header=T)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
